Snake-Water-Gun Game ðŸŽ®

This is my first Python project â€” a simple Snake, Water, Gun game where you play against the computer.  
Itâ€™s a fun project to start learning Python basics like conditionals, loops, and random choice.

ðŸš€ How to Play
Type `s` for Snake  
Type `w` for Water  
Type `g` for Gun  

The computer will randomly choose one, and the result will be shown (Win / Lose / Draw).

ðŸ“‚ How to Run
Make sure Python is installed.  
Then run the game in your terminal:

```bash
python Snake_Water_Gun_game.py
